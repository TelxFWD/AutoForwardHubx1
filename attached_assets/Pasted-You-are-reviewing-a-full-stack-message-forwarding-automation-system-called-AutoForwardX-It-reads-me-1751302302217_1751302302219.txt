You are reviewing a full-stack message-forwarding automation system called AutoForwardX. It reads messages from private Telegram channels, routes them through Discord for filtering/editing, and posts them back to Telegram. It includes trap detection, AI filtering, admin controls, and a web UI.

Please verify the following across the entire project:

üîç FUNCTIONAL COMPLETENESS CHECK

1. Does each main component exist and behave correctly?
   - Telegram Reader (Telethon): Reads and maps messages
   - Discord Webhook Handler: Receives and stores Discord messages
   - Discord Bot: Monitors for edits, traps, and replies
   - Telegram Poster Bot (Pyrogram): Posts to destination channels, supports edits/deletes
   - Telegram Admin Bot: Inline controls (pause/resume/block/trap alert)
   - Web Dashboard (UI): Config and control panel
   - Session Loader: Handles login via OTP and `.session` file creation

2. Are all required features implemented?
   - Per-pair routing (session + bot + webhook)
   - Global and pair-based blocklists
   - Trap types (text, image, edit-based)
   - AI rewriting logic (if applicable)
   - Format preservation (bold, links, replies, etc.)
   - Edit/delete sync across platforms

üß† TECHNICAL QUALITY CHECK

3. Are all functions implemented with clean, reusable logic?
4. Are modules decoupled and organized by purpose (reader, bot, poster, UI)?
5. Are environment variables securely used (e.g. no hardcoded tokens)?
6. Are API calls (Discord, Telegram) async and rate-limit aware?
7. Are there retries or error handling for failed requests?

üß™ ROBUSTNESS & SECURITY CHECK

8. Are session files validated before use?
9. Are webhooks tested and isolated per pair?
10. Are messages validated (e.g., non-empty, no banned content)?
11. Can the system recover gracefully from partial failures?
12. Are all config files versioned and readable (`pairs.json`, `blocklist.json`, `sessions.json`)?

üì¶ SYSTEM COMPLETION CHECK

13. Does the system start and stop cleanly with logs?
14. Are all necessary background tasks launched and monitored?
15. Are admin actions from Telegram Bot reflected in real-time?
16. Is there a clean way to deploy, restart, or migrate the system?
17. Are all features in the system design documentation implemented?
