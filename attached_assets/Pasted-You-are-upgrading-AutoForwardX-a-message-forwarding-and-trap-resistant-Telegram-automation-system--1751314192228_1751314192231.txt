You are upgrading AutoForwardX — a message-forwarding and trap-resistant Telegram automation system — to reach full stealth capability (100/100 score).

Please implement the following stealth-enhancing functions and integrations. The goal is to eliminate all forms of traceability, metadata, and fingerprinting.

---

## ✅ 1. Fingerprint Normalization Function
Implement:
```python
def normalize_message_fingerprint(text: str) -> str:
Remove:

Repeated punctuation: "!!!" → "!", "???" → "?"

Extra whitespace (double spaces, tabs)

Zero-width characters: \u200b, \u200c, \u200d

Normalize stylized traps:

Emojis spam like 🔥🔥🔥 → 🔥

Lines like *** ENTRY 1 *** → Entry 1

Ensure formatting (**, __, []()) is preserved

Call this before sending to Telegram Poster bot.

✅ 2. Image Re-Encoder with Metadata Strip
Implement:

python
Copy
Edit
def recompress_image(image_bytes: bytes) -> bytes:
Use PIL or OpenCV to:

Reopen image from bytes

Strip EXIF data and metadata

Recompress to JPEG/PNG

Return the recompressed image as bytes

This prevents Telegram fingerprinting via image metadata.

✅ 3. Optional Invisible Watermark (For Anti-Leak Use)
Add support for invisible ZWJ/ZWSP watermarking:

python
Copy
Edit
def inject_invisible_noise(text: str, intensity: int = 1) -> str:
Randomly inject Unicode zero-width characters between words or characters

Intensity: number of insertions per sentence

Only applied to high-risk trap-sensitive channels

✅ 4. AI Caption Rewriter (Optional)
Implement:

python
Copy
Edit
def rewrite_caption_with_ai(text: str) -> str:
Use OpenAI or Claude API to:

Rewrite the caption text in a neutral, human-like tone

Remove giveaways like "VIP", "Shared by", "🔥 Entry"

Keep intent (e.g., trade signals, instructions)

Use on captions for forwarded media or sensitive signals.

✅ 5. Poster Bot Verification
Ensure that:

You use send_message and send_photo, not forward_message

All messages are posted as bot, with no user identity

Any Telegram “forwarded from” field is removed

📁 Integration Requirements
Add normalize_message_fingerprint() to all forward pipelines

Add recompress_image() before sending any image to Telegram

Add optional toggle to enable watermark or AI caption rewrite per channel

✅ After Implementation
Log trap-resistant messages to stealth_audit.log

Confirm via test post that:

No Telegram attribution metadata exists

Message is clean, format intact, trap-safe

The goal is to complete the stealth message sanitization pipeline and achieve full anonymity against anti-forwarding techniques.
