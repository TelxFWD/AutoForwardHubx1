You are auditing AutoForwardX — a secure, AI-enhanced message-forwarding system for Telegram and Discord.

Please do a full system scan and validation to:

---

## ✅ 1. Verify All Core Functions Are Operational

### Telegram Side
- All sessions are loaded from `.session` files
- OTP login and session creation work
- Telegram userbot listens to source channels and routes correctly

### Discord Bot
- Captures messages via webhook
- Handles message edits and deletes
- Applies cleaning logic without breaking formatting

### Telegram Poster
- Posts messages cleanly to destination channel
- Edits and deletes sync via message ID mapping
- Markdown/HTML format is preserved

### Trap Detection
- Text, image hash, edit traps are detected
- Blocklist.json is correctly enforced
- Traps trigger pause logic and admin alerts

### Multi-User Copier
- Each user has independent session
- Messages are routed by per-user pair
- Paused users are skipped

### Admin Bot
- Inline buttons work (pause/resume, block image/text)
- Trap notifications and status alerts are received in real-time

### Web UI
- All pages render correctly
- Sessions and pairs can be added/updated
- Webhook config and pause toggles work

## 🛡️ 2. Validate Stealth & Untraceability Features

- The bot leaves **no attribution** or metadata in forwarded messages
- Headers/footers and mentions are **cleaned** before posting
- Edited trap messages do **not get forwarded** (edit trap detection working)
- Image traps are blocked using hash logic
- Session and bot accounts do **not expose sender identity**

---

## 🧪 3. Run Sanity & Safety Checks

- No trap message is forwarded
- No Telegram ID/user is leaked
- Message format is preserved but scrubbed
- Logs are working and don’t expose tokens or sessions
- Retry logic works if API calls fail

✅ Deliver a summary:
- ✅ What is working
- ⚠️ What needs attention
- 🔐 Confirm if the system is operating in stealth mode

The goal is a fully working, untraceable, anti-leak message forwarder.
