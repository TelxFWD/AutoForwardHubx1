Perform a comprehensive system-wide functionality test and bug fix for the entire Telegram Copier architecture based on the following key modules and features:

‚úÖ Core Functional Tests
Frontend Dashboard
Test all UI pages: Dashboard, Sessions, Pairs, TelX, Blocklists, Activity Logs, Trap Logs.

Verify:

Session creation via OTP (Test both Dashboard and TelX pages).

Pair creation and editing (Test both Telegram‚ÜîTelegram and Telegram‚ÜîDiscord‚ÜîTelegram flows).

Start, pause, and delete sessions from both UI and API.

Real-time system statistics and activity logs update correctly.

Mobile responsiveness and UI consistency.

Backend API
Test all REST API endpoints:

/api/sessions (Create, list, verify OTP)

/api/pairs (Add, edit, pause, delete, support for multiple pair types)

/api/copier (Start, stop, pause sessions, session listing)

/api/blocklists (Add, delete, list)

/api/stats (Live system health)

/api/activities (Event logging)

Validate API request and response structures, including input validation, correct typing (Zod schema matching), and appropriate HTTP status codes.

Confirm API correctly distinguishes between Telegram-Only and Telegram-Discord-Telegram pairs.

Message Forwarding Pipeline
Test multi-session Telegram reading and message capture using Telethon.

Test Discord webhook forwarding and verify correct message formatting.

Test Telegram bot posting using Pyrogram (forwarding to destination Telegram channels).

Validate bi-directional edit/delete sync between Telegram and Discord.

Advanced Security & Stealth Features
Test trap detection:

Text pattern traps.

Image hash traps.

Edit frequency monitoring with auto-pause.

Test stealth engine:

Image re-encoding and EXIF stripping.

Fingerprint normalization.

Invisible watermarking and AI caption rewriting.

Confirm proper operation of the auto-pause system on trap detection.

Admin Systems
Test Telegram Admin Bot:

Inline keyboard controls.

Pair management.

Live status and notifications.

Blocklist editing via bot.

Validate multi-user session isolation:

Separate sessions per user.

Unique OTP verification flows per user.

Per-user trap detection and forwarding rules.

Monitoring & Analytics
Confirm logs are generated per component.

Test real-time statistics: processed, blocked, forwarded message counts.

Validate system health and performance metrics.

Ensure error handling with graceful recovery and retry mechanisms.

Deployment & Configuration
Validate .env variable requirements.

Confirm PostgreSQL and in-memory fallback work seamlessly.

Check hot reloading of configuration files.

Verify environment switching (dev, staging, production).

Quality Assurance
Confirm:

TypeScript type safety.

ESLint compliance.

Consistent code formatting.

Adequate test coverage.

üîç Additional Notes:
Test session reuse across Dashboard and TelX pages.

Ensure OTP session continuity: persistent Telethon client during OTP request and verification.

Validate that pair creation correctly distinguishes between Telegram-only and Discord-involved pairs.

Ensure system does not submit unnecessary Discord fields for Telegram-to-Telegram pairs.

Confirm that auto-refresh and useEffect dependencies do not cause unwanted page reloads.

üéØ Final Objective:
Test and fix all bugs, validate the system end-to-end, ensure multi-user, multi-session, and multi-platform flows work flawlessly, and confirm the system is production-ready with full feature stability.
