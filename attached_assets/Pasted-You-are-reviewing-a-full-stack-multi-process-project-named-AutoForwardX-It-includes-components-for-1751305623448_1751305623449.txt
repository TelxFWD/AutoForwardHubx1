You are reviewing a full-stack, multi-process project named AutoForwardX. It includes components for Telegram-to-Discord and Telegram-to-Telegram message forwarding, trap detection, and multi-user management.

Please check whether the following functions are fully implemented, correctly connected, and logically sound:

---

### 🔐 Session Management (Telethon)
- Is there a way to start a session using a phone number and OTP?
- Are `.session` files created and stored securely?
- Is session metadata written to `sessions.json`?
- Can multiple sessions run concurrently?

---

### 🚦 Process Control
- Are there working APIs to start/stop/restart `userbot`, `poster`, `discord bot`, and `copier`?
- Are background Python processes handled using `subprocess` or another daemon method?
- Can each component be monitored (PID, status)?

---

### 📤 Telegram Poster
- Does it post messages to destination channels?
- Does it support Markdown/HTML formatting?
- Can it edit/delete messages if the original is changed?

---

### 🧠 Trap Detection
- Is there a centralized module to detect:
  - Text-based traps?
  - Image-based traps using hash?
  - Multi-edit traps?
- Does it return boolean or decision object for blocking messages?

---

### 🤖 Telegram Admin Bot
- Are inline buttons implemented for:
  - Pause/Resume Pair
  - Pause/Resume All
  - Add Blocked Word
  - Block Current Image
  - Show Blocklist
- Can it send alerts when traps are detected or a session fails?

---

### 🔁 Edit/Delete Sync
- Is there a mapping system to track Telegram ↔ Discord ↔ Telegram message IDs?
- When a message is edited or deleted on Discord or Telegram, is the update reflected?

---

### 📡 Telegram Copier (Multi-User)
- Can it load multiple user sessions from `user_copies.json`?
- Can each user forward multiple source → destination channel pairs?
- Are traps and formatting checks applied per user?
- Can users be paused or resumed individually?

---

### 🌐 Web Dashboard
- Can users add/edit sessions?
- Can users configure per-pair routing?
- Can users upload session files?
- Are all config JSON files properly read/written from the UI?

---

### 📦 Other Checks
- Are `.env` variables used securely (API keys, tokens)?
- Are failures logged?
- Are there retries for Telegram/Discord API failures?
- Is error handling consistent across modules?

✅ After checking, summarize the results with:
- ✅ Fully implemented and working
- ⚠️ Missing or incomplete
- 🧠 Suggestions to improve architecture, reliability, or maintainability
